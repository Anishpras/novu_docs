1. **The notification center is not loading properly.**
    
    Possible causes for the notification center not loading properly:
    
    - Invalid subscriberId
    - Invalid applicationIdentifier
    - Invalid backendUrl (in case of self-hosted)
    - Invalid socketUrl (in case of self-hosted)
2. **There is a render error due to the notification center in React.**
    
    The notification center should be wrapped in **NovuProvider**.
    
3. **What socket events are supported in the useSocket hook?**
    
    There are two events. **unread_count_changed** and **unseen_count_changed**.
    
4. **What is the difference between a redirect URL and CTA?**
    
    The redirect URL is for the entire notification, When the user will click the notification, the user will be routed to that url. CTA are two call-to-action buttons. **onNotificationClick** function prop is used for redirecting url and the **onActionClick** function prop is used for CTA. Read more about actions [here](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/react/react-components#notification-actions).
    
5. **How to create a new feed and add notifications to that feed?**
    
    Add an in-app step in a workflow. Click on the step to edit. A new workflow editor page will appear. Scroll down. There you will find an option to **Add New Feed**. You can either create a new feed or add this template to existing feeds.
    
6. **How to customize the notification center?**
    
    Everything can be customized in Novu. **useNotification** hook in react component provides a few functions to customize. The **Header**, **Footer**, **Bell** etc can also be customized.
