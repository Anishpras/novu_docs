<Info>
The default email and sms providers are for evaluation purpose only and their use in production-grade apps is not recommended. You should switch to any of our numerous other providers for production apps.

## Novu In-app Provider
In addition to email and sms, we also have in-app provider:

It is the only provider for the in-app channel and it *can be used in production apps*. Unlike sms and email, it is not active by default and needs to be turned on separately. It can be scaled as per your need and it is a 'pay as you go' offering. You can check [this](https://novu.co/pricing/) for more details.


## Limits of Providers
