Sending the first notification is fairly simple, and can be done from within the web dashboard. To send your first notification, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the workflow section from the left sidebar:

2. Click on the ‘Blank Workflow’ button to create an empty workflow:

3. You are now in the workflow editor. Here you can add steps to your workflow. We’ll just drag the email node from the right sidebar to our workflow as illustrated below:

6. Now, to execute this workflow, click on the ‘get snippet’ button from the workflow editor:

7. From the ‘run a test’ tab, you can change the email to which you want the notification. Once you’ve done that, simply click on the ‘Run Trigger’ button on the bottom right:

8. Now, go to the inbox and you’ll see the email notification there. Don’t forget also to check spam as it may sometimes land in there:
