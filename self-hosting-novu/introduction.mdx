Self-hosting Novu involves setting up and maintaining your communication infrastructure using your own servers.
While this offers full control and customization,
some features which are available only for Novuâ€™s cloud-managed won't be available in a self-hosted environment.

<Note>If you require guidance on setting up a production-scale configuration, official IaaS recommendations,
    please don't hesitate to [contact our team](https://calendly.com/novuhq/novu-meeting?utm_source=novuDocs&utm_page=self-hosting-introduction).
They can provide assistance regarding enterprise edition licenses or cloud-prem deployment to meet your specific needs.</Note>

## Minimum System Requirements
For basic installation, a server with 16GB RAM and 8 CPUs is fine. However, specifications vary depending on requirements and here are sample specifications for handling 1M plus notifications:

- If everything is running on one machine, then at least 36 vCPU and 64GB of RAM.
- If services are running across containers, then it is recommended to run 3 container per service, each container having 2 vCPU and 4GB of RAM.
- If you're using Kubernetes, then the K8 system needs to have 36 vCPU and 64GB of RAM at least in the cluster to run the servers.
- On AWS, a c6g.8xlarge instance with 32 vCPU and 64GB of RAM. 
- In all cases, you need to also have 2 Redis clusters with one having an Append only log file active (AOL),  a MongoDB cluster equivalent to a M40 or greater on Atlas, and S3 storage.

<Note>Note that these specifications are subject to your requirements, the scale of your operations, and should be adjusted as needed.</Note>
