A workflow holds the entire flow of steps (nodes) that are sent to the subscriber. This is where all the different channels are tied together under a single entity.

<Note>
Notification template has been renamed to workflow. Previously, workflow has been referred to as notification template.

## Structure

A workflow acts as the blueprint for the notifications that will be sent. The workflow encapsulates the entire flow and rules of messages that are being sent. This is where all the different channels, filters, rules and actions are tied together under a single entity.

### Each workflow comprises the following components:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name and Identifier">
    Every workflow will have a name and an identifier that are used to uniquely identify each workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger">
    The "Trigger" refers to an event or action that initiates the workflow. It signifies a call to the Novu API with a specified workflow ID, along with the necessary payload data that the workflow content will utilize.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Channels">
    In Novu, a channel refers to a preconfigured provider through which notifications are dispatched to recipients. In most instances within Novu, these channels utilize the credentials you provide to ensure the delivery of notifications on your behalf. The combination of these credentials and accompanying settings constitutes a configured channel.

    Within the Novu framework, channels are categorized into various types, each of which is linked with at least one corresponding provider that can be tailored as needed:

    - **Email** (examples include Sendgrid, Postmark)
    - **In-App** (such as feeds, toasts, banners)
    - **Push** (such as APNS, FCM)
    - **SMS** (examples include Twilio, Telnyx)
    - **Chat** (such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Discord)
    - **Webhook** (used to send webhooks to custom channels or enable your customers to configure webhooks within your product)
