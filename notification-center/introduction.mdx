The notification center is a component, also sometimes referred to as a widget that furnishes your web application with a beautiful and smooth in-app notification experience for users.

In-app notifications are different from push notifications in the sense that in-app notifications are consumed by the user in your app itself, whether push notifications are shown on the device level.

Novu provides a pre-built, ready-to-use and customizable UI component. It also allows you bring your own UI via a headless component which can be used to add in-app notifications to any platform.

## Concepts

2. `in-app notifications feed`:- List of all in-app messages sent to a particular subscriber.
3. `feeds`:- feeds are stores/tabs in which in-app messages can be grouped. One message can be in only one feed.
4. `notification actions`:- Notification actions are cta buttons below notification content which can be clicked to perform any action or external API call.
5. `redirect url` :- When a single notification item from the list is clicked then it can be configured to perform an action or redirect to any URL.
