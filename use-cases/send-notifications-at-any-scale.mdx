[Novu's Cloud](https://web.novu.co) is built to process and send notifications at any scale. For folks using the self-hosted Novu version, you can scale it up as your needs grow. 

We have companies such as Unity and Hemnet that use Novu to power their notification systems.

If you're looking to use Novu on a very large scale & you need to confirm infrastructure & scalability prowess, [please reach out to us for more information](https://calendly.com/novuhq/novu-meeting?utm_source=send-notifications-at-any-scale-docs).
