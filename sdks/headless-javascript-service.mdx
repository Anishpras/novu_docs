With just the essential API methods, users can easily incorporate our notification system into any framework or vanilla JavaScript project, without being constrained by our default UI or dependencies.

## Installation

```js
npm install @novu/headless
```

### Import in your app 

```js
import { HeadlessService, FetchResult, ISession } from '@novu/headless';
```

<Tip> If you're ready to start integrating in your JavaScript app, jump straight to the [headless quickstart.]()</Tip>

### Initialize the session 

To use the headless service and its features, you'll need to first initialize the session:

```js
const headlessService = new HeadlessService({
  applicationIdentifier: 'APP_ID_FROM_ADMIN_PANEL',
  subscriberId: 'USER_ID',
});

headlessService.initializeSession({
  listener: (res: FetchResult<ISession>) => {
    console.log(res);
  },
  onSuccess: (session: ISession) => {
    console.log(session);
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error(error);
  },
});
```
