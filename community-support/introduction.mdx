## **Run Novu Locally**

Learn how to set up Novu on your local environment for testing and development.

**[⚡ Immediate working space with Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/novuhq/novu)**

### Requirements

- Node.js version v16.15.1
- MongoDB
- Redis
- **(Optional)** pnpm - Needed if you want to install new packages
- **(Optional)** localstack (required only in S3 related modules)

Need help installing the requirements? Read more [here](https://www.notion.so/Dev-Machine-Setup-98d274c80fa249b0b0be75b9a7a72acb?pvs=21).

### Setup the project

After installing the required services on your machine, you can clone and set up your forked version of the project:

- Fork [Novu's repository](https://github.com/novuhq/novu). Clone or download your fork to your local machine.
- Run the project locally using `npm run start`.

The `npm run start` will start the Jarvis CLI tool which allows you to run the whole project with an ease. If you only want to run parts of the platform, you can use the following run commands from the root project:

- **start:dev** - Synonym to `npm run start`
- **start:web** - Only starts the web management platform
- **start:ws** - Only starts the WebSocket service for notification center updates
- **start:widget** - Starts the widget wrapper project that hosts the notification center inside an iframe
- **start:api** - Runs the API in watch mode
- **start:worker** - Runs the worker application in watch mode
- **start:dal** - Runs the Data Access Layer package in watch mode
- **start:shared** - Starts the watch mode for the shared client and API library
- **start:node** - Runs the `@novu/node` package in watch mode
- **start:notification-center** - Runs and builds the React package for the Novu notification center

### Set up your environment variables

If you have used Jarvis CLI tool from the previous step you don't need to setup the env variables as Jarvis will do that on the first run if setup wasn't done before.

The command `npm run setup:project` creates default environment variables that are required to run Novu in a development environment. However, if you want to test certain parts of Novu or run it in production mode, you need to change some of them. These are all the available environment variables:

    ❗ When configuring different than default values for the API and WebSocket URLs, in order for the Web app to apply the changes done to the `./env` file, it is needed to run the script `pnpm envsetup`. This will generate a file called `env-config.js` that will be copied inside of the `public` folder of the application. Its purpose is to inject in the `window._env_`object the chosen environment variables that manage the URLs the Web client will call to access to the API backend and the WebSocket service.

### Running tests

After making changes, you can run the tests for the respective package using the appropriate CLI commands:

### API

To run the API tests, run the following command:

```
npm run start:worker:test
npm run start:e2e:api

```

The tests create a new instance of Novu and a test db and run the tests against it. The test db is removed after all tests have finished running.

### Web

To run the front end tests for the web project using cypress you need to install localstack. The cypress tests perform E2E tests. To be able to perform E2E tests, you need to run the API service in the appropriate test environment.

Run the services in test env with the following commands:

```
npm run start:web
npm run start:api:test
npm run start:worker:test
npm run start:ws:test

```

Run the cypress test suite with the following command:

```
cd apps/web && npm run cypress:run

```

To open the cypress management window to debug tests, run the following commands:

```
cd apps/web && npm run cypress:open

```

### Different ports used by the services the project spins up

- **3000** - API
- **3002** - WebSocket Service
- **3004** - Worker application
- **4200** - Web Management UI
- **4701** - Iframe embed for notification center
- **4500** - Widget Service

### Testing providers

To run tests against the providers’ folder, you can use the `npm run test:providers` command.

### Local environment setup script (beta)

As an option in our script runner `Jarvis` we have made available an option to run [this script](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/2f2abdcaaad8a7735e0a2d488607c3276c8975fd/scripts/dev-environment-setup.sh) that will automatically try to install all the dependencies needed to be able to run Novu locally, as the previous step of installing the project dependencies through `pnpm install`. When executing it inside `Jarvis`, you will need to have previously installed by yourself `git` and `node`, as we mentioned earlier on this page.

The script can be run on its own without any previous dependency installed, as it is prepared to execute the following tasks:

- Check the running OS in the local machine (currently only MacOSx and [GNU Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy)supported)
- Install of OS dependencies (currently only MacOSx supported) -- MacOSx: It will execute the following tasks --- Will try to install or update [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (skippable step; though XCode installs `[git](https://git-scm.com/)` that is a required dependency for later) --- Will install [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211861) for Apple CPUs --- Will set up some opinionated OS settings
- Will check if `[git](https://git-scm.com/)` is installed and if not will abort the operation
- Will make [ZSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) the default shell to be able to execute the next task
- Will (opinionatedly) install [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/) (skippable task)
- Will (opinionatedly) install the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager and will set up your local environment to execute it besides adding some casks
- Will (opinionatedly) install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) as a Node.js version manager
- Will install the required [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version to be able to [run Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/2f2abdcaaad8a7735e0a2d488607c3276c8975fd/package.json#L180)
- Will install [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager, required dependency for some of the tasks inside Novu's scripts
- Will install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as containerized application development tool
- Will install required databases [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Community version) and [Redis](https://redis.io/) through Homebrew
- Will install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) tool (not required to run Novu; it is a core maintainer used tool)
- Will create a local development domain `local.novu.co` in your local machine
- Will clone the Novu repository in your local machine (skippable step) to a selected folder `$HOME/Dev`

<aside>
❗ This script has only been thoroughly tested in MacOSx. Little testing has been run in GNU Linux.

<aside>
ℹ️ This script is not bullet-proof and some of the tasks have intertwined dependencies with each other. We have tried to make it as idempotent as possible but some loose knots will probably show because of conflicts between versions of the different dependencies. Please report to us any problem found and we will try to fix or assist though we do not have the resources to make it idempotent in every potential system and potential combinations.

### Adding a New Provider

Interested in expanding Novu's capabilities? By contributing to our growing ecosystem, you can enhance Novu's reach and impact.

### How to add a new provider?

Novu currently supports five channels `in_app`, `push`, `email`, `chat` and `sms`. For `in_app` we support only our own provider, so new providers cannot be added to this channel. For the other four channels, we support the integration of external providers. This guide will help in adding new providers for any of these 4 channels. **In this guide, we are adding a new provider for the email channel, but all of the mentioned steps are similar for other channels as well**.

# Description

Providers allow us to handle message delivery over multiple channels. We have multiple providers for each channel (SMS, Email, Push and Chat). To get started with adding a new provider let's look at setting up our repository.

# Requirements

- Node.js version v16.15.1
- MongoDB
- Redis
- **(Optional)** pnpm - Needed if you want to install new packages
- **(Optional)** localstack (required only in S3 related modules)

Need help installing the requirements? Read more [here](https://www.notion.so/Dev-Machine-Setup-98d274c80fa249b0b0be75b9a7a72acb?pvs=21).

INFO

We have used pnpm package manager in this guide. You can use npm as well.

# Initialization

Fork the novu repository and clone it in your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/<'YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME'>/novu.git

```

To set up the repository, run the initial setup command:

```
pnpm run setup:project

```

At the root of the project build the `node` package to get started.

```
cd packages/node && pnpm run build

```

# Generate provider

After the project is initialized, a new provider can be generated using the below command.

```
pnpm run generate:provider

```

NOTE

Use the above command at the root of the project.

Choose the provider type.

```
> generate:provider
> npx hygen provider new

? What type
❯ EMAIL
  SMS
  PUSH
  CHAT

```

Use `up` and `down` arrow to switch `channel` type and press `enter` to select.

For this example, we will be selecting `EMAIL` as our provider type. The name for our provider will be `example-provider`.

```
? Write the provider name`kebab-cased` (e.g. proton-mail, outlook365, yahoo-mail): example-provider

```

Make sure your selected name is not conflicting with our existing provider's name. Boilerplate files for this new `example-provider` is generated in your local machine project.

> In above example, we have given our provider name as example-provider for simplicity. If provider you want to add have name as twilio, don't use twilio-provider as name, instead use twilio only. If one provider supports multiple channels like infobipsupports both sms and email channels, use infobip-email or infobip-sms to differentiate these providers.
> 

Once our `example-provider` is generated we will need to begin working from within `/providers/example-provider` directory. Make sure to write the test for this new provider.

**providers/example-provider/src/lib/example-provider.provider.ts**

```
import {
  ChannelTypeEnum,
  ISendMessageSuccessResponse,
  IEmailOptions,
  IEmailProvider,
} from '@novu/stateless';

export class ExampleProviderEmailProvider implements IEmailProvider {
  id = 'example-provider'
  channelType = ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL as ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL;

  constructor(
    private config: {
      apiKey: string;
    }
  ) {}

  async sendMessage(options: IEmailOptions): Promise<ISendMessageSuccessResponse> {
    return {
      id: 'id_returned_by_provider',
      date: 'current_time'
  }
}

```

Template test case for `example-provider`.

**providers/example-provider/src/lib/example-provider.provider.sepc.ts**

```
import { ExampleProviderEmailProvider } from './example-provider.provider';

test('should trigger example-provider library correctly', async () => {});

```

<aside>
ℹ️ Add the provider's SDK as a dependency in the provider's package.json file. Run `pnpm run setup:project` to build all dependencies again. Use this new sdk method to complete the provider's `sendMessage` function. Check the `[Important Links](https://www.notion.so/Community-and-Support-3e23f10d0e224341bd0df7ddfefd0be7?pvs=21)` section for each channel's provider example.

</aside>

# Add provider logos

In order to present this new provider in the `integration store` we need logos in dark and light mode. Add dark and light color logs in respective folders of `apps/web/public/static/images/providers` directory. Use the provider name as the file name. The sample name for our above-added provider is `example-provider.png`. The possible formats are `svg`and `png`.

# Add config items to the list

In order to build the UI integration store, we need to provide it list of all provider integrations. This part is made up of two parts:

- Create credentials config
- Add ProviderId Enum
- Add provider configuration to the providers list

### 1. Create credentials config

Every provider requires some credentials to create an instance. Novu will add these credentials fields in the integration store provider's form so that users can use their credentials to connect to their preferred provider to use for that channel notification. For example, in the above added `example-provider`, we have only one credential `ApiKey`. We will need to add a config object for `example-provider` with all existing provider's configs like below.

**libs/shared/src/consts/providers/credentials/provider-credentials.ts**

```tsx
export const exampleProviderConfig: IConfigCredentials[] = [
  {
    key: CredentialsKeyEnum.ApiKey,
    displayName: 'API Key',
    type: 'text',
    required: true,
  },
  ...mailConfigBase,
];

```

1. Here the `key` is of type `CredentialsKeyEnum`. If you want to add a new type of credentials key, you can add to `CredentialsKeyEnum`.
2. `displayName` is a human-friendly easy to understand name which will be shown in the provider integration form for this credential.
3. `type` here means text field type. this can be a string for text, text for text-area, or a switch for the toggle.
4. `required` is of boolean type.
5. `mailConfigBase` is an object having default credentials required by any `email` provider. Make sure not to add duplicate providers which are already there in `mailConfigBase`. In the case of another channel provider, we will use that channel config base in place of `mailConfigBase`.

> A credential can be made secret by adding in ./secure-credentials.ts file.
> 

### 2. Add ProviderId Enum

Add this new provider id in the respective channel provider id enum in file `libs/shared/src/consts/providers/provider.enum.ts`. As our `example-provider` is of email type, add this in `EmailProviderIdEnum` with all existing providers like below

**libs/shared/src/consts/providers/provider.enum.ts**

```tsx
export enum EmailProviderIdEnum {
  ExampleProvider = 'example-provider',
}

```

### 3. Add provider to providers list

Now we need to add the provider data to the list located at `libs/shared/src/consts/providers/channels/email.ts`. Note that the `id` is the provider's name, `displayName` is the provider's name in Pascal's case, `credentials` are the ones we created in the previous step, `logoFileName` should be as it was on the adding logo step (with the format type included).

**libs/shared/src/consts/providers/channels/email.ts**

```tsx
{
  id: 'example-provider',
  displayName: 'Example Provider',
  channel: ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL,
  credentials: exampleProviderConfig,
  // Use valid documentation link
  docReference: 'https://docs.example-provider.com/',
  logoFileName: { light: 'example-provider.png', dark: 'example-provider.png' }
}

```

# Add provider handler in the API

### 1. Adding the provider dependency in the application-generic package

In the previous step, we created a standalone provider package that will be published to NPM. However currently in our development environment, it is not yet published. In order to use it locally please go to the `package.json` located in `apps/packages/application-generic/package.json` and add it manually to the dependencies list: `"@novu/<NEW_PROVIDER_NAME>": "^<VERSION>"`

> Please note that the provider name and version can be found from the provider package.json you created earlier.
> 

After adding the dependency run `pnpm run setup:project` from the root of the mono repo. so, it can create the required symlinks for the newly created package.

### 2. Create a provider handler

In order to map internally the different providers’ credentials, we need to add a provider handler at the respective channel handlers located. For Email, it can be found at `apps/packages/application-generic/src/factories/mail/handlers`. Other channel handlers can also be found here.

Create a new file `example-provider.handler.ts` here with the following code

**packages/application-generic/src/factories/mail/handlers/example-provider.handler.ts**

```tsx
import { ChannelTypeEnum } from '@novu/shared';
import { ExampleProviderEmailProvider } from '@novu/example-provider';
import { BaseHandler } from './base.handler';

export class ExampleProviderHandler extends BaseHandler {
  constructor() {
    super('example-provider', ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL);
  }

  buildProvider(credentials, from: string) {
    const config: { apiKey: string } = { apiKey: credentials.apiKey };

    this.provider = new ExampleProviderEmailProvider(config);
  }
}

```

Add this line given below to export this handler

**packages/application-generic/src/factories/mail/handlers/index.ts**

```tsx
export * from './example-provider.handler';

```

### 3. Add handler to factory

The last step is to initialize the handler in the factory located in `packages/application-generic/src/factories/mail/mail.factory.ts`

**packages/application-generic/src/factories/mail/mail.factory.ts**

```tsx
import { ExampleProviderHandler } from './handlers';

export class MailFactory {
  handlers: IMailHandler[] = [new ExampleProviderHandler()];
}

```

# Final Steps

Now, build the project again using this command

```
pnpm run setup:project

```

Run novu in your local machine. Read [here](https://docs.novu.co/community/run-locally) to learn on how to run novu on a local machine and test this new provider.

Run the below command in the root of the project to run the providers test

```
pnpm run test:providers

```

If everything is working fine without any error, commit your local branch changes, push this branch and create a new pull request to our main repo.

Hurray 🎉! You have successfully added a new provider in Novu!

<aside>
ℹ️ In this guide, we have used only one credential `apiKey` for our `example-provider`. This is for reference purposes only. A provider can have more than one credential as per its `SDK` requirements. At each step, you will need to add all credentials carefully.
