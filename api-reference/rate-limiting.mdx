Rate limiting is an essential functionality for establishing a robust and resilient system. It safeguards system resources from being misused by malicious actors or being monopolized by one client.

It's important in regulating traffic and preventing sudden spikes that could degrade service quality.

A variable-cost token bucket rate limited algorithm has been added to provide the capability for different API controllers and methods to have a varying cost. It also lays a foundation for dynamic costing of resource consumption.
