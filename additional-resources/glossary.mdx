## 11. Environments:
Novu runs all your requests in the context of an environment. By default, Novu creates two environments when your account was created,Â `development`Â andÂ `production`.
    1. `Development environment`: The development environment is used for testing purposes and validating notification changes prior to committing them to the production environment.
    2. `Production environment`: It will be your live/production environment, you cannot make changes to this environment directly. You will first have to make the changes in theÂ `development`Â environment and then promote it toÂ `production`. This is a read-only environment.
## 12. Data associated with an environment:
        - Subscribers (canâ€™t be promoted to production)
        - Workflows (can be promoted to production)
        - Messages
        - Execution logs
        - Connected integrations (canâ€™t be promoted to production)
        - Notification feeds (can be promoted to production)
        - Brand-related assets and settings
## 13. Team members: 
Members of a team have access to the Novu web dashboard. This allows you to have individuals work on and manage templates and notifications.
## 14. Layouts: 
Layouts are HTML designs or structures to wrap the content of email notifications. Layouts can be manipulated and assigned to new or existing workflows within the Novu platform, allowing users to create, manage, and assign these layouts to workflows, so they can be reused to structure the appearance of notifications sent through the platform.
